# MorphologicalHausdorffDistance

The datasets and compiled versions are already available in the "datasets and binaries" folder, they were compiled for windows x64, and if you want to run the GPU versions you must have a Nvidia GPU and it should be device 0.

Sources are available for 2D and 3D implementations.

This approach is published in the following scientific paper:
